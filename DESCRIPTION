Title: A package to extract spatial features based on multiplex IF
        images
Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2017-10-11
Author: Daniel Gusenleitner, Jason L. Weirather
Maintainer: Daniel Gusenleitner <Daniel_Gusenleitner@dfci.harvard.edu>
Depends: R (>= 3.4)
Imports: Rcpp (>= 0.12.7), SpatialTools, gplots, spatstat, tiff, 
        RColorBrewer, methods, grDevices, graphics, stats, utils,
        data.table, ggplot2, dplyr, magrittr, tibble
Description: IrisSpatialFeatures reads the output of the PerkinElmer inForm software and
    calculates a variety of spatial statistics. In addition to simple 
    counts, it can derive average nearest neighbors for each cell-type and 
    interaction summary profiles for each celltype. These statistics are 
    derived across images, both overall and regions of interest as defined 
    by user defined masks.
